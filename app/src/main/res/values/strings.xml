    <string name="tutorial">SMS phishing criminals use text messages to steal personal information and money.
        First, verify the sender\'s phone number or identity to identify spam.
        Be wary as scammers often persuade you to click on links or provide personal information.
        Additionally, look for any spelling or grammatical errors, as many phishing messages contain typos or awkward
        phrasing. \n \n

        The image above is an example of a SMS Phishing Message. It has some visible grammatical errors and the link provided
        is a malicious link as scammers tend to use variants of the organisations they are imitating as the links for their phishing
        websites. (e.g OCBC-safety.com). OCBC official website is: ocbc.com. Additionally, even though the caller id of the message
        is OCBC, scammer can use Caller ID spoofing to mask their numbers and use the company number of OCBC instead. Do note that Phishing
        websites tend to be a few days to a few months old. Use our Weblink Validator feature to check when was the weblink created.

        \n \n \n If you are still unsure about the legitimacy of a message, do not respond or click on any
        links and instead contact the organization directly through a trusted phone number or website.
        Also Open our Phishing App and copy the message and paste the link on link checker we will fetch data from
        our database and will update about the message whether it is real message or not.
        Your message will help other users also and you can also see how many users received this spam message</string>
